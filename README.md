# Cryptography_Coding_Project_LucieANDACIC

I chose to implement the AES cryptographic algorithm in C# programming language.

Here's the demonstration that encrypts the text "The end-of-semester project!" and then decrypts it using the AES symmetric encryption algorithm.

The main method receives a plaintext, then uses its encryption method EncryptString(string plainText, string key, string iv) to encrypt the data, which has three parameters: the plaintext, the key and the initialisation vector. Finally, it uses its decryption method DecryptString(string cipherText, string key, string iv) to decode the data, which has the following three parameters: the encrypted text, the key and the initialisation vector.
